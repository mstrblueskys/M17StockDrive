description = "'MAME 2003 Midway' is compatible with MAME 0.78 ROM sets. This core variant is for Midway games only. MAME 2003/-Plus cores have tighter integration with libretro features than the more modern snapshots and are significantly faster, though this comes at a substantial reduction in both accuracy and compatibility. These cores are ideal for very weak hardware, such as Raspberry Pi and other Single-Board Computers and consoles, where even FBNeo may be too demanding. This core is only useful for devices that are RAM-constrained and cannot load the regular MAME 2003 core into memory alongside large games. If your device can run the regular MAME 2003/-Plus core (or any newer snapshot) or FBNeo, those are all better choices for most users."
